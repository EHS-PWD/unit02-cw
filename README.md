### **Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Set Up Your HTML File**:

   - Begin by adding the basic HTML document structure:
     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
       <head>
         <meta charset="UTF-8" />
         <meta
           name="description"
           content="A simple about me webpage."
         />
         <meta
           name="keywords"
           content="PLEASE ADD KEYWORDS"
         />
         <meta
           name="viewport"
           content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"
         />
         <title>About Me</title>
       </head>
       <body></body>
     </html>
     ```

2. **Add a Title to Your Page**:

   - Inside the `<body>` tag, add a heading at the top of the page:
     ```html
     <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>
     ```

3. **Create Subheadings and Paragraphs**:

   - Below the title, create subheadings using `<h2>` and `<h3>` tags. Under each subheading, add a paragraph using the `<p>` tag:

     ```html
     <h2>About Me</h2>
     <p>
       My name is [Your Name], and I am learning how to create websites using
       HTML.
     </p>

     <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
     <p>
       I enjoy coding, reading books, and playing video games in my free time.
     </p>
     ```

4. **Insert Line Breaks**:

   - Add a line break between sentences using the `<br>` tag to demonstrate its usage:
     ```html
     <p>
       I am also learning how to use different HTML tags.<br />It's fun and
       exciting!
     </p>
     ```

5. **Add Horizontal Rules**:

   - Separate sections of your webpage by adding horizontal rules using the `<hr>` tag. Add this after your subheadings and paragraphs:
     ```html
     <hr />
     ```

6. **Use a `<div>` to Group Content**:

   - Use a `<div>` to group a section of content, such as the hobbies section:
     ```html
     <div>
       <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
       <p>
         I enjoy coding, reading books, and playing video games in my free time.
       </p>
     </div>
     ```

7. **Use a `<span>` to Highlight Text**:

   - Use the `<span>` tag to apply inline styling to specific words in a paragraph (e.g., bold or change color). For example:
     ```html
     <p>
       My favorite hobby is <span style="color: blue;">coding</span> because it
       helps me solve problems.
     </p>
     ```

8. **Save and Preview Your Webpage**:

   - Save your `index.html` file.
   - Open it in a browser to make sure everything is displaying as expected.

9. **Submit Your Work**:
   - Once your page is complete, make sure you have the following in your HTML document:
     - Title using `<h1>`
     - Subheadings using `<h2>` and `<h3>`
     - Paragraphs using `<p>`
     - Line breaks using `<br>`
     - Horizontal rules using `<hr>`
     - A `<div>` to group content
     - A `<span>` to style inline text
